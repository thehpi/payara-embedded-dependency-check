# payara-embedded-dependency-check

This repository shows what the [owasp-dependency-check](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/) produces when payara-embedded is used as a dependency.

This is necessary when a custom connection validator is required (implements org.glassfish.api.jdbc.ConnectionValidation)

I would like to hear from the payara team if these CVE's are actual problems or if I can safely suppress them.

# CVE's

The active CVE's as produced by owasp can be generated by running

	mvn clean verify

Then open

	target/dependency-check-report.html

to show the dependency report.
